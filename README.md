## Overview

The project focuses on:

* Generating a **webhook** using the official API
* Solving **SQL-based questions**
* Submitting the **final SQL query** back using a POST request

Everything is done using **plain Node.js + Axios**, keeping it lightweight and clean.

## Concepts Used

### 🪝 Webhooks

A **webhook** is a URL generated by the server where you can send data back automatically.
Here, a webhook URL and access token are generated using:

```bash
POST https://bfhldevapigw.healthrx.co.in/hiring/generateWebhook
```

The response contains:

```json
{
  "webhookUrl": "https://bfhldevapigw.healthrx.co.in/hiring/webhook/xyz123",
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs..."
}
```

This webhook URL is used to submit your final SQL query.

---

### Axios

`axios` is used to handle all the HTTP requests.

Example:

```javascript
const axios = require("axios");

await axios.post(webhookUrl, 
  { finalQuery: sqlQuery },
  { headers: { Authorization: token } }
);
```

---

### SQL Query Solving

There are **two SQL problems**.
Depending on the registration number, either one is chosen automatically.

#### Query 1

Find the **highest salary credited not on the 1st day of any month**, along with:

* Name (FIRST + LAST)
* Age
* Department name

#### Query 2

For each employee, find how many **employees are younger** in the same department.
Return:

* Employee ID
* First & Last name
* Department name
* Younger employee count

---

### Flow of Execution

1. Generate the **webhook** and **token** using `axios.post()`.
2. Pick your **SQL query** (Q1 or Q2).
3. Send it back using the generated webhook with authorization.

---

### How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install axios
   ```
2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

### 💬 Notes

* No Spring Boot or Java setup is required.
* This project focuses on **understanding webhooks**, **axios**, and **SQL solving logic**.
* The webhook acts as your dynamic submission endpoint.
* `axios` helps in sending structured POST requests easily.
